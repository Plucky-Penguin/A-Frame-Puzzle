    <h1>THE TOWER OF TERROR</h1>
    <p>Greetings, you are a famous treasure hunter that has discovered an ancient tower containing untold riches.</p>
    <p>Your intel says that all of the treasure is at the top of the tower. Thankfully, someone kindly setup ladders </p>
    <p>for you to get to the top. However, you are too cautious to use them without the proper support. In order to </p>
    <p>make sure the ladders are safe, complete the puzzles to unlock the safety rails. To climb the ladder, look </p>
    <p>through the bars at the red safety rails. You will know if you got a question wrong, because of an X that appears.</P> 
    <p>You are only punished for wrong answers on the final question. However, if you get that question wrong, the tower</p>
    <p>will use it's ancient power to banish you to THE VOID, where you will roam for eternity.  </p>
    <p>Good Luck.</p>
